 Estimations of Professional Experience with Panel Data to Improve
  Salary Predictions.
 <em>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Predicting salaries is crucial in business. While prediction models can be trained on large and real salary datasets, they typically lack information regarding professional experience, an essential factor for salary. We investigate various regression techniques for the estimation of professional experience based on data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to augment data sets. We further show how to integrate such models into applications and evaluate the usefulness for salary prediction on a large real payroll dataset.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
For companies it is essential to know the market price of the salaries of their current and prospective employees. Predicting such salaries is challenging, as many factors need to be considered, and large real datasets for learning are scarce. For this reason, research on salary predictions is comparably rare and limited. In this study, we investigate whether and how an advanced machine-learning approach, namely ensembles of random-forest regression, can achieve high-quality salary predictions. We use a large real dataset of more than three million employees and more than 300 professions. Our approach learns -- for each profession -- a random-forest regression model to predict salaries. In our evaluation, we show that this approach performs better than related work on salary prediction by machine-learning approaches with a mean absolute percentage error (<em>MAPE</em>) of 17.1%. We identify reducing the number of possible values of categorical variables, training separate models as well as outlier handling as the key factors for the results achieved.

 A Time-Series Compression Technique and its Application

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Time-series data is increasingly collected in many domains. One example is the smart electricity infrastructure, which generates huge volumes of such data from sources such as smart electricity meters. Although today this data is used for visualization and billing in mostly 15-min resolution, its original temporal resolution frequently is more fine-grained, e.g., seconds. This is useful for various analytical applications such as short-term forecasting, disaggregation and visualization. However, transmitting and storing huge amounts of such fine-grained data is prohibitively expensive in terms of storage space in many cases. In this article, we present a compression technique based on piecewise regression and two methods which describe the performance of the compression. Although our technique is a general approach for time-series compression, smart grids serve as our running example and as our evaluation scenario. Depending on the data and the use-case scenario, the technique compresses data by ratios of up to factor 5,000 while maintaining its usefulness for analytics. The proposed technique has outperformed related work and has been applied to three real-world energy datasets in different scenarios. Finally, we show that the proposed compression technique can be implemented in a state-of-the-art database management system.

 Data Mining for Defects in Multicore Applications: An

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Multicore computers are ubiquitous. Expert developers as well as developers with little experience in parallelism are now asked to create multithreaded software in order to exploit parallelism in mainstream shared-memory hardware. However, finding and fixing parallel programming errors is a complex and arduous task. Programmers thus rely on tools such as race detectors that typically focus on reporting errors due to incorrect usage of synchronization constructs or due to missing synchronization. This arsenal of debugging techniques, however, is incomplete. This article presents a new perspective and addresses a largely unexplored direction of defect localization where a wrong usage of non-parallel programming constructs might cause wrong parallel application behavior. In particular, we make a contribution by showing how to use data-mining techniques to locate defects in multithreaded shared-memory programs. Our technique analyzes execution anomalies in a condensed representation of the dynamic call graphs of a multithreaded object-oriented application and identifies methods that contain a defect. Compared to race detectors that concentrate on finding incorrect synchronization, our method is able to reveal a wider range of defects that affect the control flow of a parallel program. Results from controlled experiments show that our data-mining approach not only finds race conditions in different types of multicore applications, but also other errors that cause incorrect parallel program behavior. Data-mining techniques offer a fruitful new ground for parallel program debugging, and we also discuss long-term directions for this interesting field.

The localisation of defects in computer programmes is essential in software engineering and is important in domain-specific data mining. Existing techniques which build on call-graph mining localise defects well, but do not scale for large software projects. This paper presents a hierarchical approach with good scalability characteristics. It makes use of novel call-graph representations, frequent subgraph mining and feature selection. It first analyses call graphs of a coarse granularity, before it zooms-in into more fine-grained graphs. We evaluate our approach with defects in the Mozilla Rhino project: In our setup, it narrows down the code a developer has to examine to about 6% only.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Defect localisation is essential in software engineering and is an important task in domain-specific data mining. Existing techniques building on call-graph mining can localise different kinds of defects. However, these techniques focus on defects that affect the controlflow and are agnostic regarding the dataflow. In this paper, we introduce dataflow-enabled call graphs that incorporate abstractions of the dataflow. Building on these graphs, we present an approach for defect localisation. The creation of the graphs and the defect localisation are essentially data mining problems, making use of discretisation, frequent subgraph mining and feature selection. We demonstrate the defect-localisation qualities of our approach with a study on defects introduced into Weka. As a result, defect localisation now works much better, and a developer has to investigate on average only 1.5 out of 30 methods to fix a defect.

Writing multithreaded software for multicore computers confronts many developers with the difficulty of finding parallel programming errors. In the past, most parallel debugging techniques have concentrated on finding race conditions due to wrong usage of synchronization constructs. A widely unexplored issue, however, is that a wrong usage of non-parallel programming constructs may also cause wrong parallel application behavior. This paper presents a novel defect-localization technique for multithreaded shared-memory programs that is based on analyzing execution anomalies. Compared to race detectors that report just on wrong synchronization, this method can detect a wider range of defects affecting parallel execution. It works on a condensed representation of the call graphs of multithreaded applications and employs data-mining techniques to locate a method containing a defect. Our results from controlled application experiments show that we found race conditions, but also other programming errors leading to incorrect parallel program behavior. On average, our approach reduced in our benchmark the amount of code to be inspected to just 7.1% of all methods.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In the recent past, a number of frequent subgraph mining algorithms has been proposed. They allow for analyses in domains where data is naturally graph-structured. However, caused by scalability problems when dealing with large graphs, the application of graph mining has been limited to only a few domains. In software engineering, debugging is an important issue. It is most challenging to localize bugs automatically, as this is expensive to be done manually. Several approaches have been investigated, some of which analyze traces of repeated program executions. These traces can be represented as call graphs. Such graphs describe the invocations of methods during an execution. This chapter is a survey of graph mining approaches for bug localization based on the analysis of dynamic call graphs. In particular, this chapter first introduces the subproblem of reducing the size of call graphs, before the different approaches to localize bugs based on such reduced graphs are discussed. Finally, we compare selected techniques experimentally and provide an outlook on future issues.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Deciding which computer architecture provides the best performance for a certain program is an important problem in hardware design and benchmarking. While previous approaches require expensive simulations or program executions, we propose an approach which solely relies on program analysis. We correlate substructures of the control-flow graphs representing the individual functions with the runtime on certain systems. This leads to a prediction framework based on graph mining, classification and classifier fusion. In our evaluation with the SPEC CPU 2000 and 2006 benchmarks, we predict the faster system out of two with high accuracy and achieve significant speedups in execution time.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
(Semi-)automated bug localisation is an important issue in software engineering. Recent techniques based on call graphs and graph mining can locate bugs in relatively small programs, but do not scale for real-world applications. In this paper we describe a bug-localisation approach based on graph mining that has this property, at least according to preliminary experiments. Our main contribution is the definition and analysis of class-level call graphs, with encouraging results.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
An important problem in software engineering is the automated discovery of noncrashing occasional bugs. In this work we address this problem and show that mining of weighted call graphs of program executions is a promising technique. We mine weighted graphs with a combination of structural and numerical techniques. More specifically, we propose a novel reduction technique for call graphs which introduces edge weights. Then we present an analysis technique for such weighted call graphs based on graph mining and on traditional feature selection schemes. The technique generalises previous graph mining approaches as it allows for an analysis of weights. Our evaluation shows that our approach finds bugs which previous approaches cannot detect so far. Our technique also doubles the precision of finding bugs which existing techniques can already localise in principle.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Data Mining Techniken wie Klassifikation, Regression und Clusteranalyse finden heutzutage eine weite Verbreitung. Entsprechende relationale Daten liegen in vielen Anwendungsdomänen vor, und effiziente Data Mining Algorithmen sind in kommerzielle Werkzeuge sowie in Datenbank Management Systeme integriert. In den letzten Jahren wurden aber auch verschiedene strukturelle Data Mining Techniken entwickelt, die z.B. mit Graph-basierten Daten arbeiten. Solche Techniken erschließen neue Anwendungsgebiete, bieten aber auch das Potential, bisherige Techniken zu ergänzen. Oft können durch Kombination bisherige Ergebnisse verbessert werden. In diesem Beitrag präsentieren wir Arbeiten aus dem Bereich der Vorhersage von Kundenverhalten und der Fehlersuche in Software, in denen strukturelle und relationale Data Mining Techniken erfolgreich kombiniert wurden. Schließlich geben wir einen Ausblick auf weitere Anwendungsgebiete und zukünftige Herausforderungen.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Predicting the behaviour of customers is challenging, but important for service oriented businesses. Data mining techniques are used to make such predictions, typically using only recent static data. In this paper, a sequence mining approach is proposed, which allows taking historic data and temporal developments into account as well. In order to form a combined classifier, sequence mining is combined with decision tree analysis. In the area of sequence mining, a tree data structure is extended with hashing techniques and a variation of a classic algorithm is presented. The combined classifier is applied to real customer data and produces promising results.
